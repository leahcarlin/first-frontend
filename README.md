# 😜 Give me the GIF

<!-- See the deployed version here -->

## Description

For my group-project during my full-stack javascript bootcamp, my group was given the theme of entertainment. We built a web application for developers to track their mood and generate GIF related to their mood. Login users can also write a short journal entry about how they are feeling and why and then choose to save it. Users can view a history of their moods along with their entries and GIFs.

We started with brainstorming and creating a database diagram, wireframes, and user stories followed by setting up the back end together, then working through features individually using git branches to track and review our work. We worked with GIPHY developer API to render random GIFs.
